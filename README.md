Hi 👋 My name is Elif Aslan
===========================

I am a computer engineering student
-----------------------------------

I have worked with technologies such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and Node.js. During my internship at XYZ Technology Company, I had the opportunity to work on web API systems using C# .Net. In this process, I gained experience in using the Json format and acquired knowledge about Rest API and MVC architecture. Simultaneously, through school projects, I have honed my SQL skills. I make a conscious effort to use the Git version control system in my projects. My career goal is to be a constantly improving, researching, and innovative computer engineer.
